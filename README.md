> A curated list of frameworks, libraries, tools, platforms, protocols, and resources for building agentic AI systems.

Agentic AI refers to AI systems that can autonomously plan, reason, use tools, and complete complex multi-step tasks with minimal human intervention. This list focuses on the best open-source and commercial tooling across the full agentic stack.
